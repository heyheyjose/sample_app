## Sample App

This is the sample app in Michael Hartl's <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book" target="_blank">Rails 4.0</a> tutorial. This is the main practice app that is the bulk of the tutorial. The app is supposed to be Twitter-like, with user signups/logins, follow/unfollow, microposts, ect. For me, the point of creating this application is to learn and get a deeper understanding of putting together a complete web application and deploying it to the internet.
